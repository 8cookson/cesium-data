This is a mirror of the data available at
http://www.meb.uni-bonn.de/epileptologie/science/physik/eegdata.html.

Description:
The sampling rate of the data was 173.61 Hz. For a more detailed description of
the data please refer to the manuscript. Please note, however, that the time
series have the spectral bandwith of the aquisition system, which is 0.5 Hz to
85 Hz. The application of a low-pass filter of 40 Hz, as described in the
manuscript, is regarded as the first step of analysis and therefore not carried
out for the downloadable time series.

Files:
For each set (A-E) there is a ZIP-file containing 100 TXT-files. Each TXT-file
consists of 4096 samples of one EEG time series in ASCII code.
 
SET A: Z.zip with Z001.txt - Z100.txt (564kB)
SET B: O.zip with O001.txt - O100.txt (611kB)
SET C: N.zip with N001.txt - N100.txt (560kB)
SET D: F.zip with F001.txt - F100.txt (569kB)
